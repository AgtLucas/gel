::: alert Important
Reference implementations are intended to demonstrate **what needs to be achieved**, but not necessarily how to achieve it. That would depend on the technology stack you are working with. The HTML semantics, layout, and behaviour of your implementation must conform to the reference implementation. Your JS framework, CSS methodology, and—most likely—content will differ.
